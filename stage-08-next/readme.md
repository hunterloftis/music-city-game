# Next Steps for Flappy

Here are a few ideas, in rough order of difficulty:

1. Tune the gameplay and difficulty with `FLY_SPEED`, `MOMENTUM`, `GRAVITY`, `FLAP_POWER`, `GRID_DENSITY`, etc.
2. Replace the current flappy sprite with an alternative (hint: look in stage 08's /assets).
3. Make coins float up and away instead of just disappearing when collected.
4. Introduce different types of coins with different point values (hint: look in stage 08's /assets).
5. Add multiple parallax layers to the scrolling background / foreground (hint: look in stage 08's /assets).
6. Develop a more interesting algorithm for generating the level, like one that gets more difficult further in.
7. Introduce a moving obstacle type that's more difficult to avoid.
8. Add powerups like invincibility, coin magnetism, or exploding flaps.
